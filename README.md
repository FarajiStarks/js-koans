# js-koans

This is a replica of the popular JavaScript Koans repo to be used for YI-Summer-2015 coding camp.

## Getting Started

- Fork
- Clone
- Open KoansRunner.html in a browser
- Read the error message and fix the problem (hint: you have to change /koans/AboutExpects.js line 5)
- The goal is to have all tests pass, which will be indicated by many green messages.
- Take the challenge one error message at a time.
  - figure out which file you need to modify
  - see what was expected to be the result
  - see how you can change the argument within expect() to match that expectation
